# Auto Tone

The Auto Tone feature in Lightroom Classic utilizes an AI/ML model trained to adjust slider values automatically, enhancing images based on their content. It identifies elements within the image and adjusts Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, Saturation, and Vibrance accordingly, resulting in striking photos.

In this example, we automatically adjusted the photo using the AutoTone API.

## How it works

Auto Tone analyzes the content of your image and automatically adjusts the following slider values:

- Exposure
- Contrast
- Highlights
- Shadows
- Whites
- Blacks
- Saturation
- Vibrance

The adjustments are made using an AI/ML model that has been trained to enhance images based on their specific content and characteristics.

## Example usage

You can find code samples and implementation details in the [Code Sample guide](../code-sample/index.md).
